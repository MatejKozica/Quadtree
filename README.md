# Quadtree
This project will simulate collision and distance between points in 2D space using quadtrees.

It's easy to test collision when we have a small number of objects in space, but as the number of objects grow the time to check the collision between each of time grows too.And it grows exponentially. To make collision check faster and less obsolete I will use quadtree data structure. Quadtree is basically a tree which has 4 children. I will use it to represent space. The root of the tree is initial space, if it has more than n, in my case 5, objects it will create subdivisions. Geometrically it will create 4 quadrants. But if one of that quadrants has more than 5 objects it will again split into 4 more subdivisions. You see where I am going with this? If you have a lot of objects in the space, they will be grouped in groups of 5 or less. When groups are created I will only check collision between target object and objects within his group because I know objects in other groups are too far away. In that way I will save a lot of time.
